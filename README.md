 - Basic tutorial about git and GitHub: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE) (skip it if you used git before)
 

## Week 1
   * [Lab notebook - Sept 4th](lectures/01_week_lab.ipynb)
   * [Lecture notebook - Sept 6th](lectures/01_week.ipynb)
   * Recommended Video: [Making data mean more through storytelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xsvGYIxJok) by Ben Wellington at TEDxBroadway (15 min)
   
## Week 2
 * Lab - Sept 11
   * Lab exercise - [exercises/numpy_basics.ipynb](exercises/numpy_basics.ipynb)
   * [Slides](lectures/02_week_lab.ipynb)
   * NumPy quick reference: https://github.com/juliangaal/python-cheat-sheet
   * A [playlist of several good short videos introducing different types of plots with matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl5qPnqps8M&index=2&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu4Lr8_kro2AqaO6CFYgKOl) 
This link skips the first video in the playlist because it talks about installation and you already have matplotlib installed via Anaconda.
   * [Basic plotting tutorial on matplotlib website](https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html)
 * Lecture - Sept 13
   * [Slides](lectures/02_week.ipynb) (not too many of them, most of the lecture is live / whiteboard) 
   * [Whiteboard screenshot](lectures/02_week_whiteboard.png) (png image, for full resolution click "Download" above the image)
   * [IPython transcript](lectures/02_week_ipython_transcript.py) (What the instrucor was typing - no output. Not usefully runnable as a single Python file)
   * [Facts and Myths about Python names and values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns) - by Ned Batchelder at PyCon 2015 (video, 25min)
   
## Week 3
 * Lab - Sept 18
   * Lab exercise - [exercises/plotting_basics.ipynb](exercises/plotting_basics.ipynb) (it uses [exercises/OshawaWeather2016.csv](exercises/OshawaWeather2016.csv))
   * [Slides](lectures/03_week_lab.ipynb)
 * Lecture - Sept 20
   * [Slides](lectures/03_week.ipynb)
 * Home reading & videos (important!)
   * [Video playlist about Pandas](https://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/) (watch the first 10 videos - about 1 hour 33 min total)
   * [Notebook & data used in the videos](https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos/) (GitHub) - the notebook has sufficient comments to be very useful without videos as well
   
## Week 4
 * Home assignment - [exercises/numpy_assignment.py](exercises/numpy_assignment.py) (instructions inside)
 * Lab - Sept 25
   * Lab exercise - [exercises/olympic_history.ipynb](exercises/olympic_history.ipynb)
